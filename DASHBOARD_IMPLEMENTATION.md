# AWW Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully rebuilt the Anganwadi Worker (AWW) dashboard according to your specifications. The new dashboard provides a comprehensive view of student assessments with dynamic filtering capabilities and real-time data visualization.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Static Information Cards
- **Total Students Card**: Shows the total number of students assigned to the logged-in AWW
- **Students Assessed Card**: Displays the count of assessed students based on current filter selections

### 2. Dynamic Multi-Select Dropdowns
- **Sessions Filter**: 4 sessions (Session 1-4) with multi-select capability
- **Domains Filter**: Populated from API `/api/competencies` (6 domains total)
- **Competencies Filter**: Filtered based on selected domains (17 competencies total)

### 3. Assessment Level Distribution Chart
- **Bar Chart**: Shows student distribution across 4 assessment levels
- **Assessment Levels**: 
  - Beginner (Orange)
  - Progressing (Blue) 
  - Advanced (Purple)
  - School Ready (Green)
- **Real-time Updates**: Chart updates when filters change

### 4. Level Summary Cards
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows count and description for each assessment level
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded level indicators matching chart colors

### 5. Assessment Progress Counter
- **Progress Metrics**: X assessed students out of Y total students
- **Progress Bar**: Visual percentage representation
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Based on selected filter criteria

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard uses Angular 19 with PrimeNG components, Chart.js for visualization, and follows modern UI/UX patterns with glass-morphism design, responsive layouts, and smooth animations.

## API Recommendations

### Current APIs Used
- GET /api/children (filtered by AWW's anganwadi_id)
- GET /api/competencies (domains with competencies)
- GET /api/assessments/anganwadi/{anganwadiId}/competency/{competencyId}

### Recommended Enhancement: Bulk Assessment API
For better performance, consider implementing:
GET /api/assessments/anganwadi/{anganwadiId}/bulk?competency_ids=1,2,3&sessions=1,2,3,4

This would reduce API calls from N competencies to 1 bulk request.
